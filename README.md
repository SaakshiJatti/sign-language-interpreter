# sign language interpreter
A real-time sign language interpreter built with Computer Vision. This project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and ScikitLearn to recognize a small, predefined set of hand gestures and translate them into text. It serves as a foundational exploration into gesture recognition for assistive technology.
